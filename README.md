## MY PLANNER
Welcome to this beautiful planner I made! here you will find a jumbo heading with the words work Day Planner" and the date and time. when you scroll down there is 8 rows of text boxes labeled with the time that you can write in. the buttons to the left with submit your text input and keep it there even when refeshing the page! as you will see the buttons are different colors, they change colors based on the time of day. green if future, orange is present and grey is past. I could not change the background color of the text box due to the way I styled my rows, so I changed the color of the buttons instead.

enjoy this beautiful planner!
